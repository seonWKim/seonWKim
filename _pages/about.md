A software engineer with experience building platforms for payments and stock trading systems. Along the
way, I discovered that I truly enjoy creating systems that serve real users â€” nothing feels better than seeing
my own family actively using the software I've built. I'm always open to new opportunities where I can continue
building meaningful software that makes a difference in people's lives.
